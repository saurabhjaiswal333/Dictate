# Dictate
Dictate is an Alexa skill which spells out the contents of a file to you at a desired pace. This is an engaging skill which takes a text input from you and then reads it out to 
you so that you can write it without looking at the computer screen again and again. This has also some cool features. Alexa speaks few words at a time so that we can move at our 
own pace. If the words are not clear then you can ask alexa to repeat or even spell any of these words. This skill makes the life a student easy by saving time and effort.
